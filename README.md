# Python For Mechanical Engineering
Python programs for projects concerning Mechanical Engineering

## Programs overview

### 2R Robotic Arm Simulator
Two programs have been added for simulating 2R Robotic Arm using forward kinematics. The parallel version has been tested on Linux whereas the other one has been tested on Windows and Linux. Sample plot and animation have been added as well.
